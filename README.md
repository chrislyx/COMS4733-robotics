# Learning inverse kinematics in robotics

Train a simple neural network to solve for the inverse position kinematics of the RRR manipulator. For problems in which an analytical solution is not available or easy to use, a trained regressor may be more suitable than iterative methods, since prediction is effectively a constant-time operation. This is especially useful if joint configurations must be continuously solved for in real-time.
